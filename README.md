**Conway's Game Of Life**
This is a browser based implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is not completed yet however it's functional. Open `index.html` to start the game. You can choose a custom grid size and currently you need to constantly keep clicking 'Start' to progress the simulation, I'm yet to make it automated. 

**Things to add :**
	- Make the start button toggle between 'Start' and 'Stop'.
	- Add a progression speed for the simulation (of course after making it automated).
